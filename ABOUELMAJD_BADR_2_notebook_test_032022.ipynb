There are several key advancements in\\nGraalVM Enterprise making it a preferred product for enterprises over\\nGraalVM Community, including:\\n\\nImproved efficiency with higher peak performance and lower memory footprint to lower your infrastructure\\ncosts and improve application reaction times\\nImproved security\\nfeatures to safeguard your applications across all languages\\nEnterprise support 24x7x365 to deliver peace of mind that your\\nenvironment is backed by GraalVM experts worldwide\\n\\n\\nThe last bullet is understandable for those who need support for mission-critical applications, but I find the first two rather vague.\\nI would therefore like to hear from those who have actually worked with GraalVM if\\nthe differences could be easily summarized - especially if backed by \"What does this buy us\"-data - for a developer to find out what the Enterprise version will buy us.  Especially from a native image on docker/kubernetes view, as our primary use case at the moment is Java based microservices (currently Spring Boot based, but the microprofile WAR approach is interesting to get rid of the runtime brittleness).\\n',\n",
       " 'How to find C++ spurious copy operations? Recently, I had the following \\n \\nThe problem with this code is that when the struct is created a copy occurs and the solution is instead to write return {std::move(V)}\\nAre there linter or code analyzer that would detect such spurious copy operations? Neither cppcheck, cpplint, nor clang-tidy can do it.\\nEDIT: Several points to make my question clearer:\\n\\nI know that a copy operation occurred because I used compiler explorer and it shows a call to memcpy.\\nI could identify that a copy operations occurred by looking at the standard yes. But my initial wrong idea was that the compiler would optimize away this copy. I was wrong.\\nIt is (likely) not a compiler problem since both clang and gcc produce code that produce a memcpy.\\nThe memcpy may be cheap, but I cannot imagine circumstances where copying memory and deleting the original is cheaper than passing a pointer by a std::move.\\nThe adding of the std::move is an elementary operation. I would imagine that a code analyzer would be able to suggest this correction.\\n\\n',\n",

       " 'Confusion about ctor/dtor behavior with inherited classes Until today I thought I understood inheritance much better than I apparently do.  The goal here with this example was to design a framework of n number of classes (3 in this case), which should each exist uniquely for the life of the program.  The forth class, whose implementation would contain the global main function would be responsible handling memory for the other classes.  In addition, I was hoping to keep public members in the base classes protected, to prevent any other class from calling them.\\nCurrently, the inheritance in the \"Main\" class is commented out as well as \"protected:\" keywords in each of the base classes.  It doesn\\'t do exactly what I want but everything behaves like normal.  Constructors are called once (in ascending order), each function is called followed by the destructor.\\nMy confusion here is actually two fold.  If you un-comment the inheritance in the Main class, the code compiles, but new each ctor/dtor is called twice, first in ascending order order and then descending order.  I\\'ve been unable to reason why this would occur, but it doesn\\'t seem correct. Every explanation of inheritance I have ever seen is vague and doesn\\'t explain why this would need to happen.\\n \\nMy second point of confusion is the protected members of the classes.  I would think that if I un-comment the \"protected:\" keywords, proceeding the methods in the base classes, I should be able to call them from the inherited classes.  As I understand it, I should even be able to inherit them as private, assuming I only want the children to have this functionality.  Alas, I just get error messages about the method being protected.  \\nI\\'m well aware that my understanding has some major shortfalls, but I\\'ve been exhaustively searching for an explanation with no luck.

       " 'Created my own version of Binary Search, can\\'t understand why it is faster than the regular approach? Hello to everyone who reads this post. I recently graduated and I\\'m basically going over every concept I ever learned to refresh my memory or sharpen my skills even better so that I may apply to companies and get hired. My first refresher is going over binary search and I decided to write my own version without looking over the regular approach. I happen to write the following code in which I compared the time complexity of the regular approach to my own version of binary search. Although, my binary search seems to integrate both linear search and binary search and yet it seems it is somehow faster than the regular approach and I just don\\'t understand why. Linear search is utilized for when the key is greater than the middle element, which seems like it would actually increase the time complexity of the search. You can see this within my code of the last else if condition in \"myBinarySearch\" method. Yet, even after searching through 15,000 integers of an array, my version is still faster. \\nCan anyone please explain to me why my version is much faster? Below is the regular approach compared to my version of binary search. My version is only slower when searching for a key that does not exist and is over excessive, for example, searching for 16,000. It must be excessive, because searching for 15,001 does result in a faster time of returning -1. \\nI\\'ve concluded that it is because I only used one variable as oppose to using 3 variables in the regular approach which is checking and/or updating these variables when looping through the array. Although, the linear search in the last else if statement in my method throws me off and makes me wonder how this does not increase the time complexity. \\n \\n',\n",

My question is around how the functions stored or executed in memory. \\nComing from C++/Java here is my understanding (correct me if am wrong):\\nclass definitions and functions inside them are just instructions stored in the code section of the process/thread when the program is in memory. When a class is instantiated only member variables(non-static) will be having memory allocated separately in heap. \\ni.e each object of class will have only instance variables and not function instructions. When a class function is executed via multiple objects it is executed through same location where the function is stored(i.e code section).\\nNow coming to python:\\nHere functions are treated like objects.

E.g. take a picture from one of our apps (to replicate one can download&run Apples example app for ARFaceTrackingConfiguration):\\n\\nNow I have noticed that internally ARKit treats real faces differently then it does pictures of faces. Because generally (both for   as well as  )   tries to match real world sizes and virtual object sizes, i.e. and object that is 10x10cm in your 3D editing software will match a real world object of the same 10x10cm.\\nBUT when face-tracking is used, and the phone detects an abnormally sized face (small 4cm wide face as in the picture above or a poster of a person where the face is much bigger) it will scale the FaceGeometry as if the detected face is a normal sized head, i.e. the measurements will be around ~14cm for the head width. All virtual objects will then be scaled accordingly which will make then the wrong size in the real world. C.f. the next picture:\\n \\nThe glasses 3D model is about 14cm wide, yet they are only presented as a 4cm object.\\nIn comparison, if you put the glasses on a real 3D face, they will be the correct size, on a small persons head (like 12cm) they will be slightly too big, on a big persons head (like 16cm) they will be slightly too small (as they will be their real 14cm in both cases).\\nI can even see ARKit switching between:\\n\\nFlat Face-detection using just the camera image\\nFace-Detection using the FaceID TrueDepth camera.\\n\\nwhich is especially prominent when you hold a baby in front of the app.\\nWith a babys head,   will first attempt to scale up everything so that the babys head is 14cm wide in the virtual scene and the glasses fit like on an adult.\\nThen, usually 1-2s after the head appears in the camera   will switch from mode (1) to mode (2) and show the real size of the 3D Object, which leads to supercute pictures of small baby heads with adult sized glasses (not shown here as SO isn't for sharing baby pictures).\\nSo, now for the question:\\nIs there a way of determining whether ARKit is in mode 1 or 2 ?\\n\",\n",

    "L'analyse latente de Dirichlet (LDA) est un modèle probabiliste utilisant deux valeurs de probabilité, à savoir la probabilité d'un mot donné étant donné les sujets (P(word|topics)) et la probabilité des sujets étant donné les documents (P(topics|documents)), pour obtenir des affectations de cluster. Initialement, ces valeurs sont calculées sur la base d'une attribution aléatoire, puis le calcul est répété pour chaque mot dans chaque document afin de décider de leur attribution à un sujet spécifique. Ce processus itératif permet de recalculer ces probabilités à plusieurs reprises jusqu'à ce que l'algorithme converge."
